ONTRAPORT Front-End Evaluation, Short Test
=============================

Howdy! Welcome to the ONTRAPORT front-end short test. Thank you for your interest in working with us.
Before we can continue with your application we would like you to complete a short test.  


###Test description:
The objective of this test is to have you complete a short front-end task. This will let 
us gauge your understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Please use any industry standards, best practices, performance tips and 
code style that you support. We are looking for engineers with varying skill levels so do your best.
Thank you for taking the time to take our test.

###Requirements:
1. To get started fork this repo into your own GitHub account. 
2. Using the existing form markup in `index.html`, create a script that on form submit 
   prepends the contents of the from `<input type="text" name="post" placeholder="thoughts?"/>` 
   to `<div id="page">`. 
3. For each input value prepended, concatenate the second of the current browser date to 
   the input value.
4. Once you finish coding, you can submit it to us in one of two ways. 1. Get the code into your github repository and issue a pull request. OR 2. Zip up your code and send an email to recruiting@ontraport.com with the subject line "Front-end short test". 

Feel free to use any JS or CSS frameworks.
